🥇 Priority 1: Critical Credentials & Server Access
These links should be checked first. If any of these are accessible, they represent a critical vulnerability (like exposed passwords or server keys) and should be reported immediately.

https://example.com/.env

https://example.com/.aws/credentials

https://example.com/id_rsa

https://example.com/backup/

https://example.com/log.txt

https://example.com/error.log

🥈 Priority 2: API & Source Code Exposure
This group includes endpoints that provide a "map" of the application's APIs or expose the application's source code, which often leads to finding other high-severity bugs.

https://example.com/.git/config

https://example.com/swagger-ui.html

https://example.com/swagger.json

https://example.com/graphql

https://example.com/api/config

🥉 Priority 3: High-Potential Attack Endpoints
These are functional endpoints that are common targets for high-impact vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution (RCE), brute-force attacks, or insecure file uploads.

https://example.com/api/upload

https://example.com/xmlrpc.php

https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php

https://example.com/admin/

https://example.com/dashboard/

🏅 Priority 4: Information Disclosure & Common Vulnerabilities
This group represents lower-severity (but still valid) findings. They are great for finding your first bug, as they are often overlooked.

httpsJ://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/ (Checks for user enumeration)

https://example.com/?redirect= (Checks for Open Redirect)

https://example.com/?next= (Checks for Open Redirect)

https://example.com/?url= (Checks for Open Redirect)

https://example.com/readme.html (Checks for version disclosure)
